This repository contains a raw Python script for a simple Library Book Management System. And this is not just any ordinary library management system, but it's an advanced one! For Python beginners and intermediate programmers who want to learn how to build complex applications using object-oriented programming concepts in Python. To build this application, we will use CustomTkinter and Tkinter which is are powerful toolkits which allows you to create graphical user interfaces (GUI) with Python.

This project is very useful for beginners and intermediate Python programmers. It provides a simple way to learn how to use the Python programming language by writing small programs that solves problems for people who love reading books and would manage their library within seconds. 

Hope this project is helpful for you to understand the basics of Python in a better and simplified way and gets you a better view into algorithms.

The GUI will get updates by including more features and fixing bugs.

ENJOY!

# Features of the Application:
1. Book List Method
2. Book Add Method
3. Book Remove Method


P.S.: To the Global AI Hub Mentors. I will work further on this project and update the code for the GUI here accordingly to improve and fix there are any problems.
